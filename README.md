# Anomaly detection using multiscale signatures

We combine sliding window operations with the signature transform to create a set of insightful features of time series. Then, this set of features is injected in anomaly detection methods, namely, Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and One-Class SVM (OCSVM). For an introduction to the signature method in Machine Learning, see <https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14674> (Lyons and McLeod, 2024).
